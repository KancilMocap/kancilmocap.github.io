# TCP Modules

The following module codes are designated for the following modules:

| Module code | Designation |

| 7FFE | Pilanduk |
| 7FFF | Control module (client) |
| FFFD | Kijang |

### 0002 Response

When providing all available audio, video and motion devices, the response consist of 3 main segments for the response of 0003, 0004 and 0005 respectively. Each segment would be prefixed by a 8 byte header representing the byte size of the response for that specific segment.

For instance, the response would start with the byte size of response 0003 followed by the entirety of response 0003; then the byte size of response 0004 followed by the entirety of response 0004; then the byte size of response 0005 followed by the entirety of response 0005.
